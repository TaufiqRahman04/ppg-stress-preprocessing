## About

This project implements preprocessing steps on photoplethysmography (PPG) signals aimed at stress detection. Tasks include:

- Filtering raw PPG data to remove noise/artifacts  
- Normalization / scaling  
- Signal segmentation / extraction (e.g. train / test split)  
- Feature engineering as needed (if any)  
- Preparation of data ready for classifier training and evaluation
